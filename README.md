ModularServersManager is an easy to use, free, modular, open-source game servers manager.

Although it is mainly developed for Minecraft servers, it supports most game servers that run on a terminal, like Terraria.

ModularServersManager provides an easy way to keep your servers online. Its powerful API lets you develop any kind of module, like remote (web) interfaces, advanced multi-node networks, and more!

For more information on how to get started, or develop modules for it, visit the [wiki page](/wiki).

If you find any issue, please visit the [issue tracker](/issues).

If you want to improve ModularServersManager code or the API, please fork the project and submit a pull-request.
